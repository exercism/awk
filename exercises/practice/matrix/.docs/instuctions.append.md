## Reading from a file

In this exercise, you'll be reading data from a file, not from the main input stream. 
Read about [`getline`][getline] in the Gnu awk manual,
particularly the `Getline/File` and `Getline/Variable/File` forms.

## More about arrays

A two-dimensional array might be a way to implement this solution.
GNU awk has two ways to represent one:

* [multidimensional arrays][multi]
* [arrays of arrays][a-of-a]
