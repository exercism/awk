# Exercism AWK track

AWK is a fun little language, widely used for text manipulation.
One can express a lot of functionality in very few lines of code.

## Spelling

The language is AWK.  
The interpreter is `awk` or `gawk`.

## Language variant

We'll use [GNU awk][gawk] in this track.
It may not be the default awk in any platform, but it's in widespread use and has lots of builtin goodies.
Other variants:
* mawk
* nawk
* ...

## Testing framework

Since I (@glennj) have spent a lot of time building up the bash track, I'll steal some of the learnings from it.
Testing will be done with [`bats-core`][bats]

## Support

Eventually, a `#track-awk` Slack channel.
